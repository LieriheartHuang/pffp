Step 1&2:


Step 3:

1)	I learned how to check my shopping list and managed to figure out how much I had spent in a week. I also found that I spent little money on entertainments.
2)  Most of this week's expenses were spent on basic food needs. Moreover, Discretionary spending is not as much as expected.
3)  The spending over the week is highly aligned with my core values and priorities. Additionally, it hardly deviates from my core values
4)  The expense of chocolate is easy to give up. However, a weekly visit on taco shop is not easy for me to give up since I need to improve my eating every week.
5)  The extension cord and the audio cable are hard to categorize since they do not belong to the basic need but they are still not a kind of periodic and fixed expenses. These two were categorized to NEED at last.

Step 4:
The discretionary total is $31.06 per week. Assuming that my spending each week is just like the week I tracked, I would spend $1615.12 each year on WANTS.

Step 5:
1) Based on a 6% interest rate, in 5 years, my $1615.12 will be worth $9650.86. 
2) Based on a 6% interest rate, in 25 years, my $1615.12 will be worth $93,929.54. 
3) Based on a 6% interest rate, in 45 years, my $1615.12 will be worth $364,222.68.
4) Based on a 6% interest rate, in 5 years, my $807.56 [1/2 of previous total] will be worth $___4,825.43______. 
5) Based on a 6% interest rate, in 25 years, my $807.56 will be worth $___46,964.77______. 
6) Based on a 6% interest rate, in 45 years, my $807.56 will be worth $___182,111.34______.

Step 6:
1)	Refuse to pay for any streaming sites in the future, such as YouTube and Netflix.
2)	Expenses should be counted monthly and non-essential expenses should be cut such as chocolate and coffee. Deposit the saved money in the bank and earn interest.
